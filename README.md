#### How to contribute
  
There are four branches:  
- coupling_good
- coupling_bad
- cohesion_good
- cohesion_bad
  
The aim is to have sufficient examples for all the four types (mentioned as branches) and evaluate the thrsehold metrics for `Coupling and Cohesion`
  
Please work on the appropriate branch and contribute  
Create a pull request for review and to merge on the master branch
